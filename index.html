  <h3>Advising</h3>
  <p>
    To give an American child only American History is as provincial as
    to teach a Texas child only Texas History. Patriotism is usually
    given as the reason for such history teaching. It only promotes a
    narrow-mindedness and an absurd conceit, based on utter ignorance of
    any other peoples and any other times--an intolerant egotism without
    foundation in fact. Since the World War it has become increasingly more
    and more important that American children should have a knowledge of
    other countries and other peoples in order that their attitude may be
    intelligent and unprejudiced.
